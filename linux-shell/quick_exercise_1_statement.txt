1. Create a directory "first_dir" in your home folder
2. Create an emptu file "textfile.txt inside "first_dir" directory
3. Add execute permissions to group users, and write permissions to other users to "text_file"
4. Create 3 subdirectories inside "first_dir": "sub1", "sub2", "text_file"
5. Copy the "text_file.txt" file into "sub1" directory
6. Move the "text_file.txt" into sub2 under name "text_file.txt.2"
7. Copy the whole directory "sub1" to "sub3" directory
8. Change filen name of "firstdir/sub2/text_file.txt.2" to "first_dir_/sub2/text_file.txt.backup"
9. Move "first_dir/sub2/text_file.txt.backup" to "first_dir" directory as hidden file
10. Delete the "sub2" subdirectory

To give the result of these quick exercises I have use, after some tries:
% history -25 | head -n 25 > last_25.txt
for make static the last 25 commands
% tail -n +6 last_25_hist.txt | head -13 > quick_exerceise_1_command.txt
% cp quick_exercise_1_command.txt ../Repos/master-data-science/linux-shell/
